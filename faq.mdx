  You can just use the App as you would normally do. If you encounter any bugs or have any suggestions, please report them.

    No. Your friends and kinnies are also welcome!

  <Accordion title="Are the items in the App up-to-date?">
    We always endeavour to keep the items up to date. The current version of the app is located at the bottom right of the page. The database is usually updated directly after a patch.

  <Accordion title="Are the items in the App always correct?">
    Definitely not! The Tooltips are generated automatically and are not (yet) always correct. If you find any errors, please report them. Also take a look at the "Known Issues".
